mircea_popescu rated phantomcircuit with -10. Comment: Aka Patrick Strateman. That he has the unmitigated audacity to pretend he is a Bitcoin dev is unsurprising for the history of this felon. His name is permanently besmirched by one of the most inept frauds in the history of Bitcoin (Bitcoinica). He is also famous for sending the entire userbase the email address of the entire userbase. This is the sort of moron early Bitcoin attracted.
guruvan rated phantomcircuit with -10. Comment: class A asshole. Stonewalled the bitcoinica claims process, forcing the company to liquidation. Accuses every detractor of defamation. Speaks carefully all the time, tooooooo carefully. Not trustworthy in my opinion. Runs intersango, wouldn't trust him with a shilling! Sleazy.
rdponticelli rated phantomcircuit with -10. Comment: Sorry, guys, but until the bitcoinica incident gets completely sorted out, IMHO you can't be trusted with a single satoshi more.

stamit rated PayPal with -10. Comment: The scammers owe me $126! Any transaction to you can be reversed at any time. They'll just say they aren't sure the account holder authorized the transaction . They will steal your money, lock your account and won't let you trade for BTC, even if you do it perfectly honestly and transparently.
